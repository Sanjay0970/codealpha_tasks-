# Disease Prediction System

This project predicts the likelihood of different diseases (such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, etc.) using machine learning models.  
The system takes health-related inputs from the user and classifies whether the person is at risk.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Machine learning model training & evaluation  
- Supports multiple diseases (extendable)  
- User-friendly input/output
